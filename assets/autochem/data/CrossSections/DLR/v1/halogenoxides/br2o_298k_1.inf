Gas Phase UV/Visible Absorption Spectra of HOBr and Br2O
J. Phys. Chem., 99 (1994), 1143-1150.


Data:	table	Resolution:	2.0	nm

Temperature:	298.	K

Temperature dependence:	no	

Comment:	Br2O was synthesized via rection of Br2 with HgO. Br2O could not 
be obtained free of Br2 contamination. Br2O absorption cross sec-
tions should be treated as an upper limit.
