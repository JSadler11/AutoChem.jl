Gas Phase Spectra of HOBr and Br2O and their Atmospheric Significance
submitted to Annales Geophysicae (1995)


Data:	disk	Resolution:	0.16	nm

Temperature:	298.	K

Temperature dependence:	no	

Comments:	HOBr was prepared by reaction of Br2O with H2O. Br2O was synthesized 
via rection of Br2 with HgO. Br2O could not be obtained free of Br2 
contamination.
